* Create the `Avatars` directory inside `/Users/filippo/Library/Application Support/BraveSoftware/Brave-Browser`.
* Add a new PNG image inside the `Avatars` directory. The recommended size is 190 x 190.
* The new image must be named as one of the images found [here](https://github.com/brave/brave-core/tree/master/app/theme/default_100_percent/common/avatars).
* This will override the specific avatar in the profile configuration.
* The image of the avatar will not change but, after selecting it, you will see the custom image in the top right corner.
