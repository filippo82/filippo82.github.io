<span class="firstcharacter">H</span>owdy folks!
I have always find Prefect documentation confusion. I find it difficult to digest its concepts.
For this reason, I wrote this post to demistify Prefect!


```shell
python -m venv venvs/prefect
source venvs/prefect/bin/activate
pip install -U prefect
prefect version
```
