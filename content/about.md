# Summary

ðŸ‘‹ I am Filippo. I have 10 years of experience in computational and theoretical Geophysics. I am passionate about data science, education, and teaching. Currently, I am a Solutions Engineer at [Squirro](https://squirro.com/) and, previously, I was a researcher in the [Exploration and Environmental Geophysics group](https://eeg.ethz.ch/) at ETH ZÃ¼rich. I co-supervised PhD students and MSc students, and taught a BSc class on geophysical methods. In my spare time, I run, bike, cook, build a Raspberry Pi cluster, and update my personal website.

You can find out more about me on my [curriculum vitae]({{< static "/cv/Resume_Filippo_Broggini.pdf" >}}).
