# Summary

ðŸ‘‹ I am Filippo. I am a senior solutions engineer (and jack of all trades) at [Squirro](https://squirro.com/). Previously, I was a researcher in the [Exploration and Environmental Geophysics group](https://eeg.ethz.ch/) at ETH ZÃ¼rich. I have 10 years of experience in computational and theoretical Geophysics. I am passionate about data science, education, and teaching. I co-supervised PhD students and MSc students, and taught a BSc class on geophysical methods. In my spare time (what is left after spending time with my lovely family), I read, cook, build a Raspberry Pi cluster, do sports, and update my personal website.

You can find out more about me on my [curriculum vitae]({{< static "/cv/Resume_Filippo_Broggini.pdf" >}}).

Currently, I am trying to learn more about:

* NLP techniques and tools
* [Prefect](https://www.prefect.io/)
* [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/)
* Search theory, techniques, and tools
* and much more ðŸ˜…
